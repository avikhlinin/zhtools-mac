simple addition without any coordinate shift, use "stackimages"
     
     Usage:
     ------
     addimages image1 image2 ... imageN outimage [mode=error] [expand=no]
     	
	if mode=error is set, images are added in quadrature
	if expand=no, the output image has the same size as image1; by
           default, output is expanded to hold the entire montage.
