  ROSATPSFFWHM  - print values of the width (FWHM or sigma) of the ROSAT 
		  PSPC PSF.

  Usage:
	rosatpsffwhm pspc offaxis_angle [e=E] [sigma=yes]

	"pspc" is a  word which indicates that you really want ROSAT PSPC
	offaxis_angle is off-axis angle in arcmin
	e=E set the energy at which you want the PSF width
	sigma=yes - print result as equivalent Gaussian sigma instead of FWHM

  The task prints the PSF width in arcsec and 5" pixels
