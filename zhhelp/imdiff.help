  IMDIFF     reports pixel-by-pixel differences in FITS images of the same
	     size 

  Usage:
	imdiff img1 img2 [t=t or threshold=t] [mode=rel/abs]

		t (or threshold) option sets the maximum alowable difference
                  between the images. By default it is equal to the numeric
		  precision around 1.0
                mode = rel/abs  - does threshold mean absolute or relative
		  deviation; default is mode=abs.
